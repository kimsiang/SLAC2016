\label{chap:five}

A ROOT-based offline event display is also developed to increase the user friendliness of the data analysis. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GUI}, this GUI interface allows the user to inspect the fit results of the template fit algorithm by overlaying it with the island samples.
More functionality will be added in the coming days.
