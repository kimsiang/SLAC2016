\section{Experimental setup}

An overview of the experiment setup is shown in figure~\ref{fig:overview}.
%
The calorimeter system is located inside the tunnel,
the laser system is located just outside of it and 
the DAQ backend and analysis machines are located in the control room
several floors above the tunnel.
%
Detailed description of each sub-system is given in the subsequent sections.

\caption{Overview of the experimental setup at SLAC. 
Electron beam from the ESTB beamline is moving from
the left to right before hitting the calorimeter.
The SiPM pulses resulting from the EM shower are digitized and
then processed by the frontend and backend machines to be ready for data analysis.

\section{Event topology}

Understanding the event topology is a crucial step in the data analysis.

\begin{longtable}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
Pulse type & Time [c.t.] & Crystal hit E [p.e.] & Cluster E [p.e.] \\
\hline
Sync pulse	& $\approx$ 860, 0 (before, after corr.) &	1000-2000 &	60000-80000 \\
\hline
Beam pulse & $\approx$ 2500, $\approx$ 1600 (before, after corr.)	 & 0-2500 & 2500-3000 \\
\hline
Laser pulse	& $>$ 2860 c.t., $>$ 2000 c.t. (before, after corr.) & 1000-2000 & 60000-80000 \\
